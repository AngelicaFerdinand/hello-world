An Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

My name is Angelica.

As a very young girl, I fell in love with computers. By 5 years old, I was able to use the computer by myself. The first computer I experienced ran DOS and my grandpa taught me to "park" it. There was something really satisfying about typing a command into the black box with the bright, blinking cursor and for it to pop open a game complete with awesome midi soundtrack. A couple years later, I was able to open my desktop and knew about the inner-workings to a degree. I wanted a cd-rom so I got one and I wanted to install it myself. It was a rewarding exprience for an elementary school girl. 

My grandpa used to write software for DOS and when I was little I was fascinated by it. I would watch him coding in his office and I'd ask him questions. He taught me about variables and explained a bit about what he was doing, never once . Quickbasic was the name of the language he was using, but he'd slip and call it Basic constantly because that was what he first learned. I didn't fully grasp it, but I thought it was really awesome how the code made the computer work. 


In 1998, I started to write code of my own. Instead of writing programs, I began by coding webpages. HTML was exciting for me. I loved how I could open a plain text editor like notepad, type some lines of code, save the file with the extension .htm (and later .html), and open it in a browser to display a website! If I went to a website and I liked what I saw I would right click it and view the source. It was always a great way to learn. In high school I brought CSS into the mix. I would incorporate multimedia through plugins and code snippets others freely offered for reuse. I never really thought about doing it for a living, I was always focused on pursuing medicine or research. 

Through the years I never stopped playing with HTML & CSS. I utilized both JavaScript and PHP on my sites, but in the beginning I didn't write it all by myself. I never got too deep into PHP programming, but I did use if for templating, sitewide features, and my website forms. I started coding websites for others and realized it was a lot of fun. 

It wasn't until the end of 2014 that I decided to learn JavaScript and pursue a career in programming. I took the online course from Codecademy in JavaScript and I completed it eagerly. I joined a new organization that had started to help adults learn to code full-stack JavaScript, Free Code Camp. I turned my old laptop into a Linux box and started to discover I loved it. I did a bit of jQuery and started learning Angular. I learned about Git and I started to learn about Node as well. I was enjoying every challenge along the way, but I got really distracted by some things in my personal life and had to postpone my studies. 

I'm mostly ready for front end development, but I want to review the basics before moving forward. And thus, I have begun again with renewed enthusiasm and desire for knowledge.
